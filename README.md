# Data-Splunkeing-using-Splunk
As part of the Computer Networks project at Riphah International University, I successfully designed and deployed a Data Spelunking using Splunk that integrated cutting-edge technologies to enhance data analytics and network security. The project utilized Splunk for real-time data monitoring and analysis, pfSense for advanced firewall and routing capabilities, Security Onion for comprehensive network security monitoring, and security-focused OSs (Kali Linux and Parrot Security OS) for penetration testing and privacy protection. Collaborating with a team of 10, we ensured seamless integration and functionality of the ecosystem, empowering effective decision-making, troubleshooting, and proactive threat mitigation. Presenting the project outcomes to university faculty, we received positive feedback for its significant contributions to cybersecurity and data-driven insights
